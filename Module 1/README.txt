The sounds and highscore files are inside the "Sounds + Highscore" folder. 
 
Put these files inside your sd card, without the folder of course.
 
With all of these, you should be able to play the game.
  

1. High score reading and writing should work.
	- support 10 highscores
	
2. Audio should work
	- i replaced some of the sounds because they don't come out clear 
	
3. Keyboard should work (we took out the typing name functionality). We are not going to fix the in-game holding keyboard to move thing.

4. Everything inside the game should work as before
	- speeds up at lvl 10, 20, 40, 80
	- reverses every 15 levels
		- normal from 1 to 14
		- reverse from 15 to 29
		- normal from 30 to 44
		- so on and so forth

5. You may not know this, but we have LCD functionality.
	- displays the current status of the game
		- In menus
			- display which menu we are in
		- In game
			- display the current play mode (Normal or Reverse or Game Over)
			- display how well you are doing (Owning, Dominating, Rampage, Godlike)
		
		
Go through it, test it, and if you have anything you want to change or address, skype/facebook me.
